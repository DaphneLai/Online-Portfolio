        <h1>WELCOME TO MY CRIB</h1>
        <p>Born in Canada and raised in a Vietnamese household, I’m currently an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo for Systems Design Engineering. <br> <br>
          I believe experiences is what makes humans, well, human. Having beautiful experiences is what makes life itself seem beautiful as well. When developing anything, I hope to bring together technology, environment, and design to create an experience built for the user in all their forms. <br> <br>
          I’m still learning ways to improve my craft and hope to instill positive change in this world. As ambitious as that may sound, it drives me to go farther than ever.</p>
